# System Requirements

The LUPE-2.0 App requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support Streamlit-based data analysis and interactive visualizations.

LUPE uses:  
- [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut)<sup>1,2</sup> for pose estimation  
- [A-SOiD](https://github.com/YttriLab/A-SOID)<sup>3</sup> for behavior classification  

These models are pre-trained and integrated into the app.  
👉 **Be sure to follow [Step 2 in the Local Installation Guide]** to properly obtain and place the LUPE-A-SOiD model before running the app.

> 💡 **Recommended Setup**  
> We recommend installing all dependencies using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), a package and environment manager that simplifies Python project setup and avoids conflicts.

### OS Requirements

- ✅ **Windows** – fully supported  
- ✅ **macOS** – fully supported  
- ⚠️ **Linux** – supported with manual installation of certain packages

### Python Dependencies

- Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for all necessary Python libraries.

# Local Installation & App Start Guide

### To install “LUPE-2.0-App” on your own computer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   A repository is just the project’s folder on GitHub. You need a copy of that folder on your computer.
   - **Clone** uses Git to make a local copy that stays linked to GitHub, so you can get updates later with `git pull`.
   - **OR** grab a one-time ZIP of the files by clicking **[HERE](https://github.com/justin05423/LUPE-2.0-App/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**. It’s not linked, so you won’t get updates unless you download again.

   Open your terminal / command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin05423/LUPE-2.0-App.git
   ```
   Then set the directory of your terminal/command prompt to this folder:
   ```bash
   cd LUPE-2.0-App
   ```

3. **Download the LUPE 2.0 A-SOiD Model** (If the model is **not already present** in the `Model/` folder) 
   - Download from 👉 [HERE](https://upenn.box.com/s/9rfslrvcc7m6fji8bmgktnegghyu88b0)
   - Move the contents into the `Model/` folder inside `LUPE-2.0-App` 

     > **Note**: For analyzing and retrieving pose estimation for LUPE video data, find the LUPE 2.0 DLC Model [HERE](https://upenn.box.com/s/av3i14c64rj6zls9lz6pda0it5b5q7f3).

4. **Create the Conda Environment**
   - Make sure [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is installed.
   - Open your Anaconda terminal. Run the following code to make the LUPE2App Environment:

     For **macOS / Linux**:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f LUPE2_App.yaml
      ```
      
     For **Windows**:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f LUPE2_App_Win.yaml
      ```

5. **Launch the LUPE App 🚀**
   ### Overview
   LUPE-2.0-App can be launched in **two ways**:

   i) **One-Click Launch (Recommended)** – double-click a file to start the app automatically  

   ii) **Manual Launch (Advanced)** – run Streamlit from the command line
      
   | ⚡ One-Click App Launch (Recommended) | 🛠 Manual App Launch (Advanced / Debugging) |
   |-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | **How to start**<br>Double-click a launcher file | **How to start**<br>Run Streamlit from the terminal |
   | **Command needed**<br>None | **Command needed**<br>`streamlit run lupe_analysis.py` |
   | **Best for**<br>Most users, quick startup, demos | **Best for**<br>Debugging, development, advanced use |
   | **Environment handling**<br>Automatically activates `LUPE2APP` | **Environment handling**<br>User must activate `LUPE2APP` |
   | **Browser behavior**<br>Opens automatically | **Browser behavior**<br>Opens automatically |
   | **Where it runs**<br>Local machine (`localhost`) | **Where it runs**<br>Local machine (`localhost`) |
   
   ### ⚡ One-Click App Launch (Recommended)  
      Once the environment is installed, LUPE can be launched by **double-clicking a file** — no terminal commands needed.
      
      | Operating System | Launcher File |
      |------------------|---------------|
      | macOS | `RunOS_LUPE.command` |
      | Windows | `RunOS_LUPE.bat` |
      | Linux | `RunOS_LUPE.sh` |
      
   ### 🛠 Manual App Launch (Advanced / Debugging)
      If you prefer launching LUPE manually from the terminal...
      1. Activate the LUPE2APP Environment.
         In your Anaconda terminal/command prompt, ensure you are in the `LUPE-2.0-App` directory, then run:
         ```bash
         conda activate LUPE2APP
         ```
      2. Run the App 😎 Streamlit will print the local URL and open the app in your browser automatically.
         ```bash
         streamlit run lupe_analysis.py
         ```
   
   ### 🧠 Troubleshooting Tips
      - If the app does not open automatically, check the terminal output for the local URL
      - If another Streamlit app is already running, Streamlit may use a different port
      - Always ensure `LUPE2APP` is activated before launching

# Updating LUPE App

To update your local copy of LUPE-2.0-App to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `LUPE-2.0-App` directory:
   ```bash
   cd LUPE-2.0-App
   ```
2. Pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```
3. If there are updates to the Conda environment files (`LUPE2_App.yaml` or `LUPE2_App_Win.yaml`), update your environment accordingly:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f LUPE2_App.yaml --prune
   ```
   or for Windows:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f LUPE2_App_Win.yaml --prune
   ```
4. Restart your environment and run the app as usual.
